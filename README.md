# React Simon Game

## About

Time ago, I made a Simon Game with vanilla JavaScript, for a
[FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) challenge.
Now, I made a full rewrite with React, with some improvements.

I learnt, at least, a bit about the
[JavaScript Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), pretty much
[Redux](http://redux.js.org) and some
[React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), for doing this.

Apart from that, I also use on it, for now:

- [ANIME.JS](http://anime-js.com). A pretty **AWESOME** animation library.
  I barely use it, but I wanted to use it pretty hard, so I just did.
- [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/). A very clever development by Mozilla.
  It abstracts the usage of Webpack and makes dealing with it a pretty
  enjoyable experience.

And, of course,
[other little](https://github.com/soulchainer/simongamejs/blob/master/package.json),
but valuable, things :D.

As you should know, **Simon** is a registered trademark of
[Hasbro](http://www.hasbro.com). Their use here is merely academic, for
educational purposes only, so I guess it's
[fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use).
